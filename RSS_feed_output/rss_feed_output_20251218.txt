Title: IPO Watch - High-Margin International Business Scales Up Rapidly: Unpacking Hithium Energy Storage's Global Expansion Ambition Behind its Push for a Hong Kong Listing
Summary: <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>HONG KONG, Oct 31, 2025 - (ACN Newswire) &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>The global energy transition presents an irreversible trend in the world today. Amidst this historic process, the energy storage industry is particularly critical in the construction of new power systems. Its exponential growth trajectory unequivocally declares it to be a &ldquo;Golden Track&rdquo; brimming with long-term potential. From an investment perspective, when selecting companies in the energy storage sector, leading players with high growth visibility and strong certainty are clearly the most worthwhile targets for current focus and monitoring. ZhiTong Finance believes that Xiamen Hithium Energy Storage Technology Co., Ltd. (hereafter referred to as &ldquo;Hithium Energy Storage&rdquo;), which recently filed its Application Proof for listing with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX), is a prime example.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Founded in 2019, Hithium Energy Storage has achieved an extraordinary market position in just over five years. This is naturally reflected in its financial statements, where core financial data continues to trace a steep upward curve. For instance, building on a high base from last year, Hithium Energy Storage&rsquo;s revenue reached RMB 6.971 billion in the first six months of this year, representing a massive year-on-year increase of 224.6%. Gross profit rapidly expanded from less than RMB 100 million in the same period last year to RMB 916 million, marking a robust year-on-year surge of 1073.4%. The net profit metric also underwent a simultaneous &ldquo;qualitative change,&rdquo; successfully turning profitable in the first half of the year with a profit of RMB 223 million.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Even more noteworthy, Hithium Energy Storage's latest performance trend has released a strong value signal: its more profitable international business is powerfully &ldquo;taking the baton&rdquo; to become the new &ldquo;locomotive&rdquo; contributing incremental performance. In the first half of this year, the proportion of Hithium Energy Storage's international revenue surged to 17.5%, a &ldquo;qualitative leap&rdquo; compared to 3.3% in the same period last year. While the revenue weight increased significantly, the profit potential of the international business was also initially unlocked. It is estimated that Hithium Energy Storage's international business achieved a gross margin of 30.5% in the first half, a figure significantly higher than the 9.5% gross margin of its Chinese mainland business during the same period. The rapid scaling of Hithium Energy Storage's international business is largely due to its early and acute recognition of the importance of overseas markets, evidenced by its proactive establishment of a production base in Texas, USA, making it the first Chinese company to set up energy storage system production capacity in the United States. With the rapid expansion of its international business, it is reasonable to expect Hithium Energy Storage&rsquo;s revenue scale and profitability metrics to continue growing rapidly.</p><p><img alt="" height="455" src="https://photos.acnnewswire.com/20251031SC2.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="650" /></p><p align="center" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cultivating Global Competitiveness Around Core Strategies</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The corporate history of Hithium Energy Storage can, in a way, be viewed as a classic example of the global offensive launched by Chinese manufacturing. Over the past few years, Hithium Energy Storage&rsquo;s business volume has continuously climbed new steps. According to the company&rsquo;s prospectus, the compound annual growth rate of Hithium Energy Storage&rsquo;s ESS battery shipments reached 167% from 2022 to 2024. In the first six months of this year, Hithium Energy Storage's ESS battery shipments reached 30 GWh, with a year-on-year growth rate of 252.9%. Despite the high base, there is no sign of a &ldquo;regression to the mean&rdquo; in its shipment growth rate; instead, it has further accelerated.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The secret behind the consistently rapid increase in Hithium Energy Storage's product shipments is likely embedded within the company's three core strategies. Focusing on energy storage is one of the company's core strategies. Placing Hithium Energy Storage within the industry perspective, this is clearly an &ldquo;atypical&rdquo; new energy technology company. The key feature of this &ldquo;atypical&rdquo; nature is that since its inception, the company has consistently focused solely on the energy storage sector, unlike other leading companies in the industry that disperse their focus across the upstream and downstream of the industrial chain. It is likely due to this singular focus that Hithium Energy Storage is able to better understand the fundamental logic and core challenges of the industry. The continued realization of high growth expectations this year is undoubtedly closely linked to the company's unwavering focus on the energy storage domain, based on a deep understanding of the market.</p><p><img alt="" height="366" src="https://photos.acnnewswire.com/20251031SC3.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="650" /></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In an era where technological innovation is playing a decisive role in the global competitiveness of the manufacturing industry, any manufacturing enterprise aiming to break out must establish a leading edge in technology and product capabilities. By adhering to the core strategy of building competitive barriers through R&amp;D and innovation, Hithium Energy Storage has consistently matched the vast and rapidly growing market demand with high-quality supply over the years. Data shows that Hithium Energy Storage's cumulative expenditure on R&amp;D exceeded RMB 1.5 billion from 2022 to the first half of 2025. To date, the company has assembled an R&amp;D team of over 1,030 professionals, with over 30% holding a master's degree or higher. This continuously growing R&amp;D expense and powerful R&amp;D talent pool provide the foundational support for Hithium Energy Storage to intensively launch innovative products.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of energy storage battery products, Hithium Energy Storage currently mainly offers 280Ah and 314Ah cells and has unveiled the &infin;Cell 587Ah and &infin;Cell 1175Ah ESS batteries. Furthermore, it has introduced the sodium-ion ESS battery with a cycle life exceeding 20,000 cycles. Protected by its strong core scientific and technological capabilities, the company has entered a vigorous new product cycle.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For energy storage system products, Hithium Energy Storage provides&nbsp;all-round energy storage systems with leading capabilities that can be applied in power stations, grids, data centers, commercial and industrial, and residential scenarios. Current delivered products include the 5MWh liquid-cooling energy storage system. Last month, at RE+ 2025&mdash;the largest and most influential international solar and energy storage exhibition globally, held in Las Vegas, USA&mdash;Hithium Energy Storage unveiled energy storage solutions for AI Data Centers&nbsp;(AIDC), such as the &infin;Power 6.25MWh 8h lithium-ion long-duration energy storage system.</p><p><img alt="" height="695" src="https://photos.acnnewswire.com/20251031SC4.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="650" /></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Its core R&amp;D innovation strength has also provided crucial assistance for Hithium Energy Storage to achieve scaled production and extreme efficiency. It is reported that Hithium Energy Storage has continuously overcome technological bottlenecks and successfully iterated four generations of smart factories within the last three years, leading to a continuous decline in unit manufacturing costs over the past three years. Currently, the company&rsquo;s fifth-generation factory is also under construction and is expected to commence operation next year. Combined with the explosive growth in Hithium Energy Storage&rsquo;s shipment data, it is fair to say that &ldquo;Hithium Smart Manufacturing&rdquo; has become a reality. Furthermore, the prospectus reveals that the &infin;Cell 587Ah, &infin;Cell 1175Ah, and &infin;Cell N162Ah ESS battery cell products, as well as the &infin;Power 6.25 MWh 2h/4h ESS system product, are all expected to achieve mass production in the second half of the year, which will lead to a continued significant increase in Hithium Energy Storage&rsquo;s shipments in the latter half of the year.</p><p align="center" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How to Evaluate the Investment Value of an &ldquo;Evolving&rdquo; Energy Storage Leader?</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Looking across the global capital markets, star technology stocks in mainstream markets have generally been favored by capital this year. The clear dominance of the growth style is underpinned by emerging industries, including new energy, which are gradually becoming critical drivers stimulating current economic growth, thereby guiding market consensus and capital flows.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Given Hithium Energy Storage's strong growth DNA, its consistent delivery on growth expectations over the past few years, and its high growth visibility for the future, it is anticipated that the company will become a highly sought-after &ldquo;hot commodity&rdquo; in the new stock market after its listing on the HKEX.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Reviewing its historical performance, Hithium Energy Storage achieved a compound annual growth rate of 89% in revenue from 2022 to 2024. The gross profit margin significantly jumped from 11.3% in 2022 to 17.9% in 2024. Concurrently, the net profit metric achieved a historic turnaround in 2024, reaching RMB 288 million. Over the same period, the company's metric of total assets minus current liabilities also grew annually, increasing from RMB 718 million in 2022 to RMB 1.701 billion in 2024, indicating a continuously optimizing balance sheet. Building upon the high-performance base of 2024, Hithium Energy Storage's core financial data continued its rapid advance in the first half of this year, strongly fulfilling growth expectations.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A detailed analysis shows that Hithium Energy Storage&rsquo;s proactive adjustment of its business structure and market strategy is also a key reason for the leap in its financial data. In terms of business structure, the company continues to promote the development of businesses with higher added value. According to data from the prospectus, the revenue from energy storage systems accounted for 18.3% of total revenue in the first half of this year, a significant increase from 7.9% in the same period last year. From a profitability perspective, the gross margin for the ESS System business was 29.7% in the first half, notably higher than the 9.7% gross margin for the ESS Battery business. The rising weight of high-margin business clearly had a positive impact on increasing the company's profits.</p><p><img alt="" height="285" src="https://photos.acnnewswire.com/20251031SC5.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="650" /></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Regarding its market strategy, as stated at the beginning of the article, Hithium Energy Storage has achieved global operations covering the entire value chain, guided by its globalization strategy. In 2024, the company's international revenue ratio historically rose to 28.6%. In the first half of this year, Hithium Energy Storage's revenue scale and revenue contribution ratio in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, and other countries and regions in Asia all significantly increased. All evidence indicates that Hithium Energy Storage's strategic move to establish advanced production capacity in the United States played an extremely critical role in the further scaling of the company's overall performance in the first half of this year. Currently, the company's strategy of building a diversified global market is accelerating in its effectiveness, and its reliance on any single regional market is significantly reduced.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ZhiTong Finance believes that Hithium Energy Storage's track record has already proven it to be a company with deep growth DNA. Furthermore, considering the broad prospects of the energy storage sector and the company's long-term strategy of increasing its presence in international markets, the company's growth sustainability and visibility are excellent. Therefore, Hithium Energy Storage can be considered a high-potential stock in the energy storage field with significant long-term investment value. A company that aligns with market preference and investor expectations, upon its successful listing on the HKEX, is highly likely to be sought after by various capital sources.</p><br /><br /> Copyright 2025 ACN Newswire.

Title: IPO Watch - High-Margin International Business Scales Up Rapidly: Unpacking Hithium Energy Storage's Global Expansion Ambition Behind its Push for a Hong Kong Listing
Summary: <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>HONG KONG, Oct 31, 2025 - (ACN Newswire) &ndash;&nbsp;</strong>The global energy transition presents an irreversible trend in the world today. Amidst this historic process, the energy storage industry is particularly critical in the construction of new power systems. Its exponential growth trajectory unequivocally declares it to be a &ldquo;Golden Track&rdquo; brimming with long-term potential. From an investment perspective, when selecting companies in the energy storage sector, leading players with high growth visibility and strong certainty are clearly the most worthwhile targets for current focus and monitoring. ZhiTong Finance believes that Xiamen Hithium Energy Storage Technology Co., Ltd. (hereafter referred to as &ldquo;Hithium Energy Storage&rdquo;), which recently filed its Application Proof for listing with the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (HKEX), is a prime example.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Founded in 2019, Hithium Energy Storage has achieved an extraordinary market position in just over five years. This is naturally reflected in its financial statements, where core financial data continues to trace a steep upward curve. For instance, building on a high base from last year, Hithium Energy Storage&rsquo;s revenue reached RMB 6.971 billion in the first six months of this year, representing a massive year-on-year increase of 224.6%. Gross profit rapidly expanded from less than RMB 100 million in the same period last year to RMB 916 million, marking a robust year-on-year surge of 1073.4%. The net profit metric also underwent a simultaneous &ldquo;qualitative change,&rdquo; successfully turning profitable in the first half of the year with a profit of RMB 223 million.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Even more noteworthy, Hithium Energy Storage's latest performance trend has released a strong value signal: its more profitable international business is powerfully &ldquo;taking the baton&rdquo; to become the new &ldquo;locomotive&rdquo; contributing incremental performance. In the first half of this year, the proportion of Hithium Energy Storage's international revenue surged to 17.5%, a &ldquo;qualitative leap&rdquo; compared to 3.3% in the same period last year. While the revenue weight increased significantly, the profit potential of the international business was also initially unlocked. It is estimated that Hithium Energy Storage's international business achieved a gross margin of 30.5% in the first half, a figure significantly higher than the 9.5% gross margin of its Chinese mainland business during the same period. The rapid scaling of Hithium Energy Storage's international business is largely due to its early and acute recognition of the importance of overseas markets, evidenced by its proactive establishment of a production base in Texas, USA, making it the first Chinese company to set up energy storage system production capacity in the United States. With the rapid expansion of its international business, it is reasonable to expect Hithium Energy Storage&rsquo;s revenue scale and profitability metrics to continue growing rapidly.</p><p><img alt="" height="455" src="https://photos.acnnewswire.com/20251031SC2.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="650" /></p><p align="center" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Cultivating Global Competitiveness Around Core Strategies</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">The corporate history of Hithium Energy Storage can, in a way, be viewed as a classic example of the global offensive launched by Chinese manufacturing. Over the past few years, Hithium Energy Storage&rsquo;s business volume has continuously climbed new steps. According to the company&rsquo;s prospectus, the compound annual growth rate of Hithium Energy Storage&rsquo;s ESS battery shipments reached 167% from 2022 to 2024. In the first six months of this year, Hithium Energy Storage's ESS battery shipments reached 30 GWh, with a year-on-year growth rate of 252.9%. Despite the high base, there is no sign of a &ldquo;regression to the mean&rdquo; in its shipment growth rate; instead, it has further accelerated.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The secret behind the consistently rapid increase in Hithium Energy Storage's product shipments is likely embedded within the company's three core strategies. Focusing on energy storage is one of the company's core strategies. Placing Hithium Energy Storage within the industry perspective, this is clearly an &ldquo;atypical&rdquo; new energy technology company. The key feature of this &ldquo;atypical&rdquo; nature is that since its inception, the company has consistently focused solely on the energy storage sector, unlike other leading companies in the industry that disperse their focus across the upstream and downstream of the industrial chain. It is likely due to this singular focus that Hithium Energy Storage is able to better understand the fundamental logic and core challenges of the industry. The continued realization of high growth expectations this year is undoubtedly closely linked to the company's unwavering focus on the energy storage domain, based on a deep understanding of the market.</p><p><img alt="" height="366" src="https://photos.acnnewswire.com/20251031SC3.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="650" /></p><p style="text-align: justify;">In an era where technological innovation is playing a decisive role in the global competitiveness of the manufacturing industry, any manufacturing enterprise aiming to break out must establish a leading edge in technology and product capabilities. By adhering to the core strategy of building competitive barriers through R&amp;D and innovation, Hithium Energy Storage has consistently matched the vast and rapidly growing market demand with high-quality supply over the years. Data shows that Hithium Energy Storage's cumulative expenditure on R&amp;D exceeded RMB 1.5 billion from 2022 to the first half of 2025. To date, the company has assembled an R&amp;D team of over 1,030 professionals, with over 30% holding a master's degree or higher. This continuously growing R&amp;D expense and powerful R&amp;D talent pool provide the foundational support for Hithium Energy Storage to intensively launch innovative products.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of energy storage battery products, Hithium Energy Storage currently mainly offers 280Ah and 314Ah cells and has unveiled the &infin;Cell 587Ah and &infin;Cell 1175Ah ESS batteries. Furthermore, it has introduced the sodium-ion ESS battery with a cycle life exceeding 20,000 cycles. Protected by its strong core scientific and technological capabilities, the company has entered a vigorous new product cycle.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For energy storage system products, Hithium Energy Storage provides&nbsp;all-round energy storage systems with leading capabilities that can be applied in power stations, grids, data centers, commercial and industrial, and residential scenarios. Current delivered products include the 5MWh liquid-cooling energy storage system. Last month, at RE+ 2025&mdash;the largest and most influential international solar and energy storage exhibition globally, held in Las Vegas, USA&mdash;Hithium Energy Storage unveiled energy storage solutions for AI Data Centers&nbsp;(AIDC), such as the &infin;Power 6.25MWh 8h lithium-ion long-duration energy storage system.</p><p><img alt="" height="695" src="https://photos.acnnewswire.com/20251031SC4.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="650" /></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Its core R&amp;D innovation strength has also provided crucial assistance for Hithium Energy Storage to achieve scaled production and extreme efficiency. It is reported that Hithium Energy Storage has continuously overcome technological bottlenecks and successfully iterated four generations of smart factories within the last three years, leading to a continuous decline in unit manufacturing costs over the past three years. Currently, the company&rsquo;s fifth-generation factory is also under construction and is expected to commence operation next year. Combined with the explosive growth in Hithium Energy Storage&rsquo;s shipment data, it is fair to say that &ldquo;Hithium Smart Manufacturing&rdquo; has become a reality. Furthermore, the prospectus reveals that the &infin;Cell 587Ah, &infin;Cell 1175Ah, and &infin;Cell N162Ah ESS battery cell products, as well as the &infin;Power 6.25 MWh 2h/4h ESS system product, are all expected to achieve mass production in the second half of the year, which will lead to a continued significant increase in Hithium Energy Storage&rsquo;s shipments in the latter half of the year.</p><p align="center" style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How to Evaluate the Investment Value of an &ldquo;Evolving&rdquo; Energy Storage Leader?</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Looking across the global capital markets, star technology stocks in mainstream markets have generally been favored by capital this year. The clear dominance of the growth style is underpinned by emerging industries, including new energy, which are gradually becoming critical drivers stimulating current economic growth, thereby guiding market consensus and capital flows.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Given Hithium Energy Storage's strong growth DNA, its consistent delivery on growth expectations over the past few years, and its high growth visibility for the future, it is anticipated that the company will become a highly sought-after &ldquo;hot commodity&rdquo; in the new stock market after its listing on the HKEX.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Reviewing its historical performance, Hithium Energy Storage achieved a compound annual growth rate of 89% in revenue from 2022 to 2024. The gross profit margin significantly jumped from 11.3% in 2022 to 17.9% in 2024. Concurrently, the net profit metric achieved a historic turnaround in 2024, reaching RMB 288 million. Over the same period, the company's metric of total assets minus current liabilities also grew annually, increasing from RMB 718 million in 2022 to RMB 1.701 billion in 2024, indicating a continuously optimizing balance sheet. Building upon the high-performance base of 2024, Hithium Energy Storage's core financial data continued its rapid advance in the first half of this year, strongly fulfilling growth expectations.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A detailed analysis shows that Hithium Energy Storage&rsquo;s proactive adjustment of its business structure and market strategy is also a key reason for the leap in its financial data. In terms of business structure, the company continues to promote the development of businesses with higher added value. According to data from the prospectus, the revenue from energy storage systems accounted for 18.3% of total revenue in the first half of this year, a significant increase from 7.9% in the same period last year. From a profitability perspective, the gross margin for the ESS System business was 29.7% in the first half, notably higher than the 9.7% gross margin for the ESS Battery business. The rising weight of high-margin business clearly had a positive impact on increasing the company's profits.</p><p><img alt="" height="285" src="https://photos.acnnewswire.com/20251031SC5.jpg" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" width="650" /></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Regarding its market strategy, as stated at the beginning of the article, Hithium Energy Storage has achieved global operations covering the entire value chain, guided by its globalization strategy. In 2024, the company's international revenue ratio historically rose to 28.6%. In the first half of this year, Hithium Energy Storage's revenue scale and revenue contribution ratio in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Australia, and other countries and regions in Asia all significantly increased. All evidence indicates that Hithium Energy Storage's strategic move to establish advanced production capacity in the United States played an extremely critical role in the further scaling of the company's overall performance in the first half of this year. Currently, the company's strategy of building a diversified global market is accelerating in its effectiveness, and its reliance on any single regional market is significantly reduced.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">ZhiTong Finance believes that Hithium Energy Storage's track record has already proven it to be a company with deep growth DNA. Furthermore, considering the broad prospects of the energy storage sector and the company's long-term strategy of increasing its presence in international markets, the company's growth sustainability and visibility are excellent. Therefore, Hithium Energy Storage can be considered a high-potential stock in the energy storage field with significant long-term investment value. A company that aligns with market preference and investor expectations, upon its successful listing on the HKEX, is highly likely to be sought after by various capital sources.</p><br /><br /> Copyright 2025 ACN Newswire.

(TSXV: EMN) (ASX: EMN) (FSE: E060) (the "<strong>Company</strong>" or "<strong>Euro Manganese</strong>") is pleased to provide an update as it continues to advance its Chvaletice Manganese Project ("<strong>Chvaletice</strong>") in the Czech Republic toward commercialization. The update reflects ongoing efforts to align project execution and development priorities with evolving market conditions and learnings from the operation of the Demonstration Plant.</p><p><strong>President &amp; CEO, Martina Blahova, commented: </strong></p><p>"With our Demonstration Plant having validated the Chvaletice process and product quality, our focus has shifted to translating these learnings into commercial-scale efficiencies. Our focus on recovery and costs aims to achieve meaningful improvements in unit operating costs and capital intensities. We see sustained demand for high-purity manganese across both lithium-ion and sodium-ion chemistries, and Euro Manganese is working to respond to this critical need."</p><p><strong>Global Market Outlook and Company Strategy</strong></p><p>Global demand for high-purity manganese continues to strengthen as electric-vehicle ("<strong>EV</strong>") and energy storage markets expand and diversify. Manganese-rich cathode chemistries are gaining traction for both lithium-ion and emerging sodium-ion batteries due to their cost, performance and safety advantages. Independent forecasts anticipate significant supply shortfalls post-2027, underscoring the need for secure, low-carbon sources outside of China.<sup>1</sup></p><p>Euro Manganese's strategy - to establish a fully traceable European supply of high-purity manganese feedstocks remains well-founded. The Company's Chvaletice Project offers a unique combination of proven technology, circular production from recycled tailings, and alignment with Europe's strategic autonomy and energy-transition goals, working towards supplying the EV, energy-storage, defence, and speciality-alloy sectors.</p><p><strong>Validation of Metal-Route Optionality</strong></p><p>A report prepared by Andrew Zemek at Marketeye, (September 2025)<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;and paid for by Euro Manganese confirms that Euro Manganese's metal-route process is the most flexible way of future-proofing the output of the Chvaletice Commercial Plant in the context of changing demand for the manganese feedstock mix for high-manganese batteries. The process provides strategic optionality to produce high-purity electrolytic manganese metal ("<strong>HPEMM</strong>") and/or high-purity manganese sulphate monohydrate ("<strong>HPMSM</strong>"). This dual-route capability positions the Company to respond dynamically to future shifts in cathode chemistries and customer requirements. HPMSM remains the dominant feedstock for cathode chemistries, however new materials such as manganese oxide (Mn&#8323;O&#8324;) and manganese carbonate (MnCO&#8323;) have emerged. These alternative manganese feedstocks can be produced from HPEMM.</p><p><strong>EMN's Chairman, Rick Anthon, commented:</strong></p><p>"Euro Manganese's strategic advantage lies in its combination of strong project fundamentals, proven flowsheet, and alignment with Europe's decarbonisation and economic security goals. The optimization program aims to ensure we maintain our competitive edge and build on our first mover advantage in Europe with a goal of reducing costs and maximising value for shareholders, while delivering a sustainable source of high-purity manganese for the battery market and other strategic sectors."</p><p><strong>Optimization and Efficiency Program</strong></p><p>Following the successful operation of its Demonstration Plant, Euro Manganese has initiated an optimization program to incorporate operational learnings into design of the Commercial Plant. Key workstreams include exploring:</p><ul><li><p>Improved recoveries and metallurgical balancing;</p></li><li><p>Optimized equipment-sizing and layout;</p></li><li><p>Reduced reagent and consumables use; and</p></li><li><p>Enhanced process control.</p></li></ul><p>The Company has engaged external engineering specialists, including a large engineering firm, to conduct independent reviews and recommend efficiency upgrades. This structured, best-practice approach mirrors successful programs across the battery and mining sectors that have delivered lower capital intensity and stronger commercial and sustainability outcomes for other companies.</p><p><strong>Next Steps and Outlook</strong></p><p>The outcomes of the optimization program will guide Euro Manganese's next phase of development, including any potential updates to technical studies.</p><p>The Company remains confident that its strategic focus on producing high-purity manganese feedstocks, supported by continued engineering discipline and process improvements, positions it to capitalize on the forecasted supply deficit and growing demand for manganese-rich battery materials. The Chvaletice Project's fundamentals as a fully traceable, low-carbon, European source of high-purity manganese remains robust.</p><p><strong>About Euro Manganese</strong></p><p>Euro Manganese Inc. (TSXV: EMN) (ASX: EMN) (FSE: E060) is a battery materials company developing the Chvaletice Manganese Project in the Czech Republic, Europe's only near-term source of high-purity manganese, a critical ingredient in next-generation electric vehicles, energy storage batteries and defence applications.</p><p>The Chvaletice Manganese Project will reprocess historic mine tailings to produce high-purity electrolytic manganese metal (HPEMM), and high-purity manganese sulphate monohydrate (HPMSM), establishing a fully traceable, low-carbon supply chain within the European Union.</p><p>With its Demonstration Plant having produced on-spec products and optimization work underway to enhance commercial plant efficiency, Euro Manganese is positioned to become Europe's first domestic producer of high-purity manganese, meeting the rising demand for sustainable, strategic battery materials while advancing Europe's clean-energy and supply-chain independence goals.</p><p>Euro Manganese is dual listed on the TSX-V and the ASX.</p><p>Authorized for release by the President and CEO of Euro Manganese Inc.</p><p>Neither TSX-V nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX-V) or the ASX accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.</p><div id="contactInfo"><p><strong>Enquiries</strong></p><p><strong>LodeRock Advisors</strong><br />Neil Weber<br />Investor and Media Relations - North America<br />+1 (647) 222-0574<br /><a href="mailto:neil.weber@loderockadvisors.com">neil.weber@loderockadvisors.com</a></p><p><strong>Jane Morgan Management</strong><br />Jane Morgan<br />Investor and Media Relations - Australia<br />+61 (0) 405 555 618<br /><a href="mailto:jm@janemorganmanagement.com.au">jm@janemorganmanagement.com.au</a></p><p><strong>Martina Blahova</strong><br />President and CEO<br />+1 (604) 681-1010<br /><br /><strong>Company Address</strong>: #709 -700 West Pender St., Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, V6C 1G8<br /><strong>Website</strong>: <a href="https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/MqYRni3OmB">www.mn25.ca</a><br /><strong>Follow us on</strong>: <a href="https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/bgB02UJ8Ay">LinkedIn</a> | <a href="https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/3KGL5trOW0">X</a> | <a href="https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/zA7Keu8zb3">YouTube</a><br /><strong>Click Here to</strong> <a href="https://api.newsfilecorp.com/redirect/XEBV2IKEYw">Subscribe to our mailing list for updates</a></p></div><p><strong>Forward-Looking Statements </strong></p><p>Certain statements in this news release constitute "forward-looking statements" or "forward-looking information" within the meaning of applicable securities laws.

Title: Wintermar Offshore (WINS:JK) Reports 9M2025 Results
Summary: <p><img border="0" src="https://www.acnnewswire.com/images/company/Wintermar150.jpg" /></p><p><strong>JAKARTA, Nov 3, 2025 - (ACN Newswire) - </strong>Wintermar booked a 25.1%YOY rise in 9M2025 Operating Profit to US$14.7million, supported by an 11.6% increase in Owned Vessel Revenue and rising Gross Margins.</p><p><strong>Owned Vessel Division</strong></p><p>Owned Vessel Revenue rose by 11.6%YOY to US$50.3million for 9M2025, driven by a significant increase in High Tier vessel utilization to 76% for 9M2025 compared to 59% in 9M2024.</p><p>Average charter rates for our fleet have risen around 5% since end 2024 whereas average utilization for 9M2025 was 60.4%, lower than utilization rates of 67% achieved in 9M2024. The lower utilization stemmed from the large number of spot contracts for our mid-tier fleet in 2025, which is characteristic of this early phase of the oil and gas investment cycle where most of the OSV demand is for seismic/survey or the exploration and construction, where projects tend to be completed in several weeks.&nbsp; In the mid-tier segment, the utilization of HLB was lower in 3Q2025 compared to 2Q2025 due to completion of spot contracts.</p><p>Overall, the higher charter rates for the fleet compensated for lower overall fleet utilization this year, leading to a rise in gross margins for the Owned Vessel Division to 38% from 30% in 9M2024. Total Gross Profit for the Owned Vessel Division amounted to US$20.1million (+29.6%YOY) for 9M2025. Although the fleet is still impacted by fluctuations in quarter-to-quarter utilization as the majority of vessels are still on spot contracts, we are confident that there will be longer term contracts coming up in 2026-2027 as more projects head into the development and production phase of the oil and gas investment cycle.</p><p><strong>Chartering Division and Other Services</strong></p><p>Contribution from the Chartering Division has declined, with gross profit of US$0.35million for 9M2025 compared to US$1.2million in 9M2024.&nbsp; This was because a few chartered vessels completed a project which will not be resuming this year. This reduction has been offset by higher Gross Profit from Other Services, which rose 8.1%YOY to US$1.8million from an increase in commissions, fees and other service income.</p><p><strong>Direct Expenses and Gross Profit</strong></p><p>Total Owned Vessel Direct Costs rose by 2.2%YOY to US$30.2million for 9M2025, due to higher depreciation and crewing costs.&nbsp; Depreciation rose to US$10.5million (+3.6%YOY) with the operation of 3 additional HLB vessels and 1 PSV compared to 9M2024.&nbsp; Crewing costs roseto US$8.1million (+7.6%YOY) as a result of a higher number of Dynamic Positioning (DP) vessels in the fleet and higher salaries for crew on international contracts. Fuel costs are borne by charterers while a vessel is on contract, and with more high tier vessels chartered out compared to the previous year, the overall fuel expenses fell by 19.1% YOY to US$1.76million in 9M2025.</p><p><strong>Indirect Expenses and Operating Profit</strong></p><p>Total Indirect Expenses rose by 14%YOY or US$0.9million to US$7.5million for 9M2025, with salary costs, employee benefits and staff training accounting for US$0.6million of this increase.&nbsp; As our business has expanded internationally, we have invested more heavily into human resources, particularly in the technical and technology divisions, and expanded our crew training and development programs to invest in developing young marine graduates and electrical engineers to have practical experience on board our fleet to be ready for future international operations.</p><p>Operating Profit grew by 25.1% YOY to US$14.7million for 9M2025 compared to US$11.8million in 9M2024.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Other Income, Expenses and Net Attributable Profit</strong></p><p>Net interest expenses rose by US$0.4million as higher interest expenses were offset by interest income. Net gearing stands at only 0.6% as at end September 2025.&nbsp;</p><p>Equity in Associate Companies fell to US$0.6million in 9M2025, from US$2.1million in 9M2024, due to poorer utilization in 3Q2025 and increased capital costs related to the award of a new long-term contract.</p><p>There were no vessel sales in 3Q2025, and only one vessel sold in 2Q2025, realizing a gain of US$1.7million for 9M2025.&nbsp; This represents a sharp decline compared to 2024 which included a large one-off gain booked from vessel sales in 2024 where the Company made&nbsp; US$17.4million from the sale of several vessels including a significant gain from the sale of a PSV.</p><p>Total Other Income for 9M2025 stood at US$1.3million which resulted in a net income before tax of US$16.1million for the nine months period year to date.</p><p>Net profit attributable to shareholders for 9M2025 amounted to US$9.2million compared to US$19.7million in 9M2024. Net income before Non-Controlling Interest in 9M2025 fell to US$14.4million compared to US$27.2million in 9M2024 which included the impact of the PSV sale.&nbsp;</p><p>EBITDA for 9M2025 rose by 15%YOY to US$25.5million, compared to US$22.1million in 9M2024. This reflects the strong cash flow enjoyed by the Company as most of the past vessel loans have been repaid.<br /><br /><strong>Industry Outlook&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The OSV industry was not spared from the global uncertainty in investor sentiment this year. Concerns over US tariffs and a potential global economic slowdown caused oil prices to trend lower, which led to a more cautious environment and delays in contract awards. Charter rates for OSVs which had risen sharply from 2021 to 2024 also saw a correction this year.</p><p>The Oil and Gas investment cycle is a long-term cycle over several years from award of concessions to production. Due to the lack of investment in new reserves over a 8-year period until 2021, we are firmly optimistic that the longer-term fundamentals indicate continued investment in oil and gas exploration.&nbsp;</p><p>In the Offshore Supply Vessel (OSV) industry, there has been nearly no newbuilding of high tier Dynamic Positioning (DP) equipped vessels from 2015 to 2022. The softening in OSV charter rates this year is expected to be short term in nature as the limited supply of operationally ready OSVs points to a sustained shortage of OSV supply in the coming years.&nbsp; This is illustrated in the chart below, which shows the active fleet compared with the small number of idle PSVs and charter rates for the period 2023-2025. From the data, demand continues to be high with overall global fleet utilization close to 90%.</p><p><strong>Business Prospects</strong></p><p>The short-term weakness in oil prices over the past quarter reflects the volatile geopolitical sentiment which has been driven by changing news flows more than industry fundamentals.&nbsp; The structural outlook for oil and gas supply support stable oil prices, resulting from years of underinvestment in new reserves.&nbsp; In 2025, there have been several projects in Indonesia which are still at the early stage of the investment cycle, where seismic and exploration work only necessitates spot contracts.&nbsp; This has caused volatility in our fleet utilization.&nbsp; However, the long investment cycle from exploration to production indicates that there will be more demand in the coming years as these projects will continue towards production targets in 2027.&nbsp; This will underpin OSV demand in the coming years.&nbsp; Taking into consideration the limited orderbooks for new OSVs to be delivered in the coming years, we remain very optimistic that charter rates and utilization will improve in the coming years, as we continue to add high value vessels.</p><p><strong>Award of long-term contract in Brunei</strong></p><p>Our associate company, Fast Offshore Supply Pte Ltd (FOS), based in Singapore, has been awarded a tender to supply 5 newbuild 55-metre Crew Transfer Vessels (CTVs) under a five-year charter contract in Brunei for delivery in 2027.
